# Synthra Boards

Fully custom-designed FPGA boards by **Adam Łuczak**, created in Eagle PCB.  
Synthra is a modular FPGA board series for learning, prototyping, and embedded development.

---

## Purpose

The goal is to provide compact yet expandable FPGA boards suitable for:

- digital logic and HDL education,
- rapid development and testing,
- small-to-medium scale logic-based systems.

Each board is optimized for modifiability, signal accessibility, and easy hand-soldering.
